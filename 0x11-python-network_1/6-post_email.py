Python script that takes in a URL and an email address, sends a `POST` request
to the passed URL with the email as a parameter, and finally displays
the body of the response.
  * The email must be sent in the variable `email`
  * You must use the packages `requests` and `sys`
  * You are not allowed to import packages other than `requests` and `sys`
